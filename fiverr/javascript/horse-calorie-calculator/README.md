What i need: 

- yearlings can not have an activity level of "in training". all other ages can, 

- if in training, the mcal and grams of protein per kilogram rate increases. 
    - there are separate requirements for horses in training. for the purpose of making it quicker. you can make the mcal and protein needs of horses 2, 3, anf 4. 
    
- in training all 0.055 mcal per kg input weight, and 2.3g of protein per kg input weight. 
    - but can you list them in separate if statements so that i can edit the values later?
