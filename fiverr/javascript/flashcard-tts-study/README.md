### Keyboard shortcuts:

1) when A is pressed: 
- directly show the answer (with the fade-in as usual). 
- Then run the timer as usual (depending on delay slider) and show the next question and continue as usual.

2) When S is pressed: 
- skip to next question (with the fade-in as usual). 
- Display the next question as usual (depending on the delay slider) and then continue as usual.

3) When P is pressed: 
- The (Pause/Start Learning) left button is pressed once



Here are the 3 cases when the code is acting up slightly:

1) "S" is pressed after the answer is displayed: 
- I set the delay timer to 20 seconds and hit "S" after the answer is displayed. It stalls for a while, before moving to the next question. We might need update the "S" functionality, so the next question is asked immediately after the S is pressed

3) After the answer "A" is pressed, it shows the answer correctly but waits too long before the next question. So if the Delay timer is set to 15 seconds, after 15 seconds of pressing the A, we will move to the next question - currently it's taking longer.
