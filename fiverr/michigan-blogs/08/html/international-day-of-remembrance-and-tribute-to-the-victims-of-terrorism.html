<h1>International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism: Coping with Trauma</h1>

<p>Trauma is a human reaction to experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. These events can include violent acts, natural disasters, serious illness or injuries, sexual abuse, and many other events that feel shocking or disturbing.</p>
<h2>The Signs and Symptoms of Trauma</h2>
<p>Within the days or weeks that follow the traumatic event, a person may find themselves on a rollercoaster of confusing thoughts, emotions, and memories as their brains attempt to process and cope with the trauma. While trauma can look different in everyone, there are a few common signs and symptoms one may find themselves experiencing. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li >Feeling anxious, nervous, jumpy, or paranoid</li>
<li >Sadness</li>
<li >Guilt</li>
<li >Anger</li>
<li >Changes to sleeping and eating habits</li>
<li >Social withdrawal</li>
<li >Flashbacks or nightmares related to the event</li>
<li >Low mood</li>
<li >Avoiding situations that may remind the person of the traumatic event</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, these signs and symptoms will begin to fade with time. However, a few may find themselves struggling to find healing, developing mental health conditions like anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Coping with Trauma</h2>
<p>Fortunately, researchers have found a few effective coping mechanisms one can use to work through traumatic events. These include:</p>
<h3>Talking to Someone You Trust</h3>
<p>Reaching out to loved ones for support may be critical in finding your healing. Accept your loved one&rsquo;s support, help, and comfort as you navigate the difficult emotions and memories associated with the traumatic event.</p>
<h3>Allow Yourself to Feel Your Feelings</h3>
<p>All healing takes time. As you ride out your rollercoaster of emotions, make sure to take the time to allow yourself to feel what you are feeling. Every emotion, no matter how confusing, is valid when you are experiencing grief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is completely normal to wish to avoid anything associated with the traumatic event, excessive avoidance can prevent you from being able to cope with the trauma in a healthy and effective way. Ease your way back into your daily routine as you cope with your trauma.</p>
<h3>Continue to Take Care of Yourself</h3>
<p>Your brain&rsquo;s resilience is dependent on your overall health and wellbeing. This is why it is so important to continue caring for yourself as you navigate your way through the trauma you have experienced.
