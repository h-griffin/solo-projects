<h1>  International Overdose Awareness Day: Do I Have a Substance Abuse Problem? </h1>

<p>A substance use disorder (SUD) can be <a
    href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health"><span
        >defined</a> as a mental health condition
    impacting the functioning of a person&rsquo;s brain and their behavior. The mental health disorder is a
    condition in which a person feels unable to control their substance use. These substances typically include
    legal or illegal drugs or medications and alcohol and the symptoms of the disorder can range from mild to
    severe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons a person may turn to addictive substances. They may feel
    pressured by the company they keep, may be attempting to numb difficult emotions, or may be experiencing other
    mental health conditions that leave them vulnerable to addiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUD can look different in everybody. However, there are a few different signs and
    symptoms one can look for if they believe themselves to be struggling with a substance abuse problem. These
    signs and symptoms include:</p>
<h2>Feeling the Need to Use the Substance Regularly</h2>
<p>Whether you are experiencing an alcohol or drug addiction, you will likely find
    yourself craving and using the substance multiple times a day, every single day. Excessive use of these
    substances are one of the most obvious signs that one is experiencing a substance abuse problem.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing a substance use problem, you may have found yourself
    attempting to cut back on your substance use with no success. Every effort to cut the substance out, whether you
    attempt to go cold turkey, create a strict schedule, or join a support group, may still result in failure until
    you can find the professional help you need.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Obsessing Over the Substance</h2>
<p>Substance abuse problems can begin to take over a person&rsquo;s life. One of the
    biggest telltale signs of a substance use disorder is an obsession with obtaining and using the substance, no
    matter the consequences it may bring. Because of this, many people experiencing addiction and substance use
    problems find that their careers, relationships, health, safety, finances, and overall quality of life are
    suffering due to their addiction.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You Need More of the Substance Than You Needed Before</h2>
<p>Substances like alcohol, drugs, and certain medications can trigger the dopamine
    levels within your brain. Because of this, your brain begins to crave more and more of the euphoria and
    &ldquo;high&rdquo; associated with the drug. However, your brain also becomes desensitized to the dopamine
    brought on by the substance. As your brain becomes desensitized to your original dosage of the substance, it
    will require larger amounts in order for the euphoric high to be triggered.&nbsp;</p>
