                            <h1><strong>9/10 World Suicide Prevention Day: Recognizing the Suicidal Warning Signs</strong></h1>

                            <p>September 10 has been deemed World Suicide Prevention Day, which is precisely why we have decided to dedicate today&rsquo;s article to working to prevent suicide by recognizing the warning signs. While suicide is not considered a mental illness, it is often caused by the presence of mental illnesses, like depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, and many others.</p>
                            <h2><strong>The Warning Signs of Suicide</strong></h2>
                            <p>One of the most crucial steps to take in preventing suicide is by recognizing the warning signs of suicide. These warning signs can include:</p>

                            <li>Extreme sadness, irritability, and overall moodiness</li>

                            <h2><strong>What to Do If You Are Worried Someone May Be at Risk of Suicide?</strong></h2>
                            <p>If you are worried that a loved one may be at risk of suicide, showing them that you are there to love and support them may be immensely helpful. Begin by asking them if they are feeling depressed or suicidal. This may present an opportunity for them to open up about the difficult emotions and thoughts swirling through their heads. You can then validate their feelings, offer your support, and encourage and help them reach out to a mental health professional to get the help they need. Continue to be there for them even after it seems as though the worst part is over.</p>
