<h1><strong>7/12 National Simplicity Day: The Mental Health Benefits of Simplifying Your Life</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 12 is National Simplicity Day, a day dedicated to living a simpler, less complex life. In these days of social media flaunting, it can be easy to fall into the trap of the &ldquo;more is more&rdquo; mentality. As we live our day-to-day lives, comparing our lifestyles, belongings, home, friend groups, and family to Instagram and TikTok stars sharing their greatest highlight reels, comparison and jealousy can find their way of creeping into our everyday thoughts. Despite the happiness your favorite social media influencer appears to exude every time they post a new unboxing video or shopping haul, researchers have suggested that a simpler life may lead to even more happiness.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Mental Health Benefits of a Simpler Life</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplifying your life can mean a lot of things. Maybe it means you spend less time-consuming media. Perhaps it includes decluttering your home. Or maybe it means surrounding yourself with fewer, high-quality friends and relationships. Either way, taking small steps to simplify your life can have a multitude of benefits on your mental health and overall wellbeing, including:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fostering Creativity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearing out the unnecessary pieces of time throughout your day, like scrolling through social media and binging the latest Netflix show, can allow you to make time for fostering your creativity. Creativity is a crucial piece of a full and happy life. Whatever you want to make time for, whether it be dancing, singing, writing, painting, or something else, you will have the time and energy for through simplifying your life.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Reducing Stress</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Issues with clutter, whether in our physical environment, on our to-do list, or in the relationships we foster, have been&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219461/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">linked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;to higher stress levels and overall life dissatisfaction. Taking the time to declutter and simplify your life can be a great way to reduce stress levels and live happier and healthier.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Building Joy</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you constantly search for the next great thing, it can be challenging to enjoy the moment you are living. This is why simplifying your life can allow you to experience true joy and contentment. When you declutter your thoughts and desires, your life becomes exactly what you dream it to be, rather than what society tells you a happy life should look like.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Living a Fuller Life</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplifying your life allows you more time to live. As you cut out unnecessary tasks and objects, you can maintain the energy and time needed to do the things you want to do.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Improving Concentration and Overall Brain Functioning</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simpler life allows you to declutter your space, brain, and time. The stress reduction and overall life satisfaction this offers can allow your brain to function at a higher, more effective level than before.</span></p>
