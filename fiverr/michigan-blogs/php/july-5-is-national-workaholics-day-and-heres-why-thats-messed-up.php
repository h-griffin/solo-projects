                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 5 has been deemed National Workaholics Day, and we, for one, are not impressed. Why? Because the research has already shown just how harmful workaholic habits can be to employees everywhere. So many face burnout, stress, depression, and a load of other mental health issues.</span></p>
                                <h2><strong>What is Burnout?</strong></h2>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burnout is a mental health condition faced by many employees in the workforce these days. The condition is a form of mental exhaustion that is caused by an overload of work and results in struggles with mental health, concentration, and motivation.</span></p>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons one may face burnout, such as:</span></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with micromanagement</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an excessive workload</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in a hostile environment</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having unclear work expectations</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having unrealistic deadlines to meet</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burnout can look different in all of us. However, there are a few common signs one can look for if they believe they are struggling with it. A few signs and symptoms of the mental health condition include:</span></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constantly feeling exhausted, unhappy, and stressed when thinking about your work</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coping with negative feelings about your work</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being unable to concentrate on your work</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing lower quality work</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel unmotivated to complete your work</span></li>

                                <h2><strong>Coping with Burnout</strong></h2>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coping with burnout can be especially difficult when you don&rsquo;t have the resources to just up and quit your job because you have outgrown it. Just because quitting is not an option for you does not mean that you will have to continue to suffer through your burnout. There are a few ways you can combat burnout without quitting, including:</span></p>
                                <h3><strong>Examining Your Thought Patterns</strong></h3>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When struggling with burnout, it can be easy to see nothing more than the negative aspects of your job. Work to reframe your thoughts to remind yourself of a time your job was just what you wanted and why. Who knows? You may fall in love with it all over again!</span></p>
                                <h3><strong>Make Time for Yourself</strong></h3>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your workload is preventing you from properly caring for yourself, your mental and physical health will both take a hit. Prioritize creating healthy routines that involve self-care rituals like working out and participating in activities you enjoy.</span></p>
                                <h3><strong>Talk to Someone</strong></h3>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a social species, after all, which means that each and every one of us could benefit from talking with someone we trust. Maybe it&rsquo;s somebody who can make important changes, like your boss or coworkers. Or, maybe it&rsquo;s somebody who just makes you feel supported during your struggles. Either way, you will feel better after&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauladavis/2021/06/22/how-to-talk-about-burnout-at-work/?sh=75e16dcc5d3f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;up.</span></p>
                                <h3><strong>Building a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong></h3>
                                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a healthy work-life balance is one of the most important things you can do to prevent and cope with burnout. After having hustle culture pushed so hard on our society for so long, it may seem difficult to even know where to begin building this healthy work-life balance. A few ways you can get started include:</span></p>
                                <ul>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting strict, clear boundaries with your job</span></li>
                                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping work away from your home life</span></li>
