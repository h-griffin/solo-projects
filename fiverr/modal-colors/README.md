I need help with a project I've been assigned to do.
Attached is an image mockup file, called modal.png.
I need you to create a css file that produces the mockup image.

I've attached 3 files, the mockup image, the sample css file and the corresponding html file. I was told that no editing the html file is needed.

these are the instructions that were provided to me:
"Open the modal.css file and use CSS to achieve the above modal (and list styling) in your preferred formatting. You should not have to modify the HTML in any form to
achieve the result."
