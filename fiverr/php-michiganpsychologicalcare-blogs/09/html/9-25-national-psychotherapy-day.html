<h1><strong>9/25 National Psychotherapy Day: What is Psychotherapy</strong></h1>
<p>Happy National Psychotherapy Day- a day dedicated to educating and raising awareness about one of the most commonly used mental health treatments. Psychotherapy, otherwise referred to as talk therapy, is a form of therapy used to treat a wide array of mental health issues and conditions. This effective form of therapy has been used to treat a wide variety of mental health issues, including depression, stress, anxiety, trauma, physical illness, and loss.</p>
<h2><strong>What to Expect in a Psychotherapy Session</strong></h2>
<p>Psychotherapy can be conducted in individual, family, couples, and group counseling. The most important part of the psychotherapy process is developing a trusting relationship between the client and therapist. This is because this form of therapy is highly dependent on the client&rsquo;s ability to feel safe enough to open up to their psychotherapist about the thoughts and emotions that are troubling them the most. Without full participation and trust between the therapist and client, psychotherapy will not be effective.</p>
<p>Each psychotherapy session will range between approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://psychiatry.org/patients-families/psychotherapy">30 to 50 minutes</a>&nbsp;and can be short-term (lasting only a few sessions) or long-term (lasting for months or years). Short-term psychotherapy is best for those who are experiencing immediate issues, like loss or stressful life events. Long-term psychotherapy is best for those experiencing enduring or more complicated mental health issues, like anxiety disorders or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<h2><strong>The Many Faces of Psychotherapy</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the many faces mental health struggles can take on, there are a few different forms psychotherapy can take. These forms include:</p>
<h3><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong></h3>
<p>The goal of CBT is to help the client identify and change thinking patterns that are negatively impacting their mental health and overall quality of life.</p>
<h3><strong>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)</strong></h3>
<p>DBT is a form of CBT used to help individuals learn better ways to regulate their emotions.</p>
<h3><strong>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</strong></h3>
<p>IPT is a short-term mental health treatment with the goal of developing healthy emotional expression, communication, and relationships.</p>
<h3><strong>Psychodynamic Therapy</strong></h3>
<p>Psychodynamic therapy is a form of therapy with the goal of improving self-awareness and changing negative patterns and behaviors to allow the individual to take better control over their own life.</p>
<h3><strong>Supportive Therapy</strong></h3>
<p>Supportive Therapy works with the goal of helping clients develop their own toolbox for getting through difficult life situations. This form of therapy is used to improve an individual&rsquo;s self-confidence, reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and improve one&rsquo;s overall social health.</p>
<p>While one form of psychotherapy may work on some individuals, it will not work for all. This is why psychotherapy has such a wide array of different treatment methods and goals. Each and every single one of us is our own person. This means we all have different struggles, goals, and challenges. Working with an experienced psychotherapist will allow you to find the right treatment for your experience.</p>
