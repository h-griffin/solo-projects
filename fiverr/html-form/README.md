# i have changed the A tag over to an INPUT tag, line 32
as html already has a built in submit button/type for forms, and while A tags can be used for submissions, it needs some javascript for an onClick() funtion, which may cause problems when JS is disabled(viewing in html). for now its best to keep A tags for links(href) and
INPUT tags for user submission :)

here is a link to W3 schools page on html forms for more examples on built in html tags!

i have also changed the email over to Larry@sanfernandovalleybookkeeping.com and it opens up an email draft for me.
