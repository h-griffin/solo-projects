<h1><strong>How to Challenge Fear of Failure Through Behavioral Experiments</strong></h1>
<p>Being fearful of failure is a common thought pattern that keeps people stuck in their thought patterns and prevents them from moving forward. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201306/10-signs-that-you-might-have-fear-of-failure">Fear of failure</a> supports self-doubt and will often hold people back from achieving things in their lives. Fearing failure also leads to low self-worth because people think that if they fail, they are not worthy. One way to combat a fear of failure is to use skills taught through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT uses behavioral experiments to test these negative beliefs. Behavioral experiments help to show people struggling with negative thinking that their thoughts might not be based on fact. Challenging these beliefs helps to improve mental health and strengthen <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12059759/">mental resilience</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Are Behavioral Experiments?</strong></h2>
<p>Behavioral experiments are experiments that are used in <a href="https://nicic.gov/resources/topics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT) to help collect evidence that supports or disproves unhelpful or negative thinking patterns. When people partake in behavioral experiments, they are testing their beliefs in real situations. In most cases, people will learn in the experiments that the fears they had rarely came true the way they thought they would. These experiments also help to show people that they can handle the uncomfortable feelings that may arise with their fears.</p>
<h2><strong>Origin of Fear of Failure</strong></h2>
<p>When people develop a fear of failure, it usually stems from an experience in their early years of life. Sometimes people will have a critical caregiver or a childhood trauma. Sometimes children will internalize situations or actions with loved ones and peers. The fear of failure develops over time because people tend to avoid situations they are fearful of. When they avoid these situations again and again over time, this will eventually reinforce the fears over time.&nbsp; Having a fear of failure can also stem from feelings of perfectionism throughout life.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How Behavioral Experiments Challenge Fear of Failure</strong></h2>
<p>Behavioral experiments challenge the fear of failure over time because they help the person struggling see that their fears may not be as threatening as they thought. Through repetitive actions over time, the situations that people fear become less threatening and stressful. Behavioral experiments also help to build self-trust. People can prove to themselves that they can face their fears, which helps them trust themselves more. After completing behavioral experiments, people might see improvement in self-esteem and motivation.</p>
<p>Fearing failure is a common fear that people have regarding important life situations. Challenging these beliefs will help improve mental health symptoms and beliefs about oneself.&nbsp; Behavioral experiments are a helpful way to challenge <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-fear-of-failure-5176202">self-doubt</a> and increase mental resilience. It&rsquo;s important to start small with these experiments to make sure to avoid discouragement. These experiments take time to plan and execute, but they&rsquo;re always worth the effort. Living life without the fear of failure will bring freedom, self-trust, and improvement in mental health symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
