<h1>Mental Health Tips for Highly Sensitive People (HSPs)</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/highly-sensitive-person">Highly Sensitive Person</a> is an individual who is more emotionally and physically sensitive to various factors in life. Being a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) is a personality trait, not a mental condition. However, these traits can make people more prone to certain mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What is a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)?</strong></h2>
<p>The term "Highly Sensitive Person" (HSP) is used to describe individuals who are easily overwhelmed by both positive and negative stimulation. People with this personality trait tend to be creative, introverted, and highly empathetic.</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges For Highly Sensitive People</strong></h2>
<p>Highly Sensitive People are prone to certain challenges as a result of their traits. One challenge that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4086365/">HSPs</a> face is that they usually process things deeply and ruminate over past decisions. Highly Sensitive People are usually empathetic and oftentimes pick up on the emotions of those around them. These tendencies result in HSPs having higher stress levels and emotional exhaustion.</p>
<h2><strong>Mental Health Tips for HSPs</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Prioritize rest and sleep. Getting enough sleep is a great way to lower stress levels and strengthen cognitive functions. This can help HSPs stay strong and not become overwhelmed by their emotions or outside stimuli. Self-care is important for everyone, but especially for HSPs, to avoid burnout.

    <li>Journaling or logging emotions. HSPs can use journaling as a way to track their moods and triggers. Journaling can also be used as a form of expression of feelings. People can use journal prompts if they are new to the practice and are not sure what to write about.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Schedule breaks throughout the day. It can be common for HSPs to become overwhelmed easily if they have a lot on their plate or higher stress levels. By scheduling intentional breaks, HSPs can ensure that they will not become too overwhelmed in between their tasks for the day.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Create routines or rituals. Highly Sensitive People can use routines to keep a framework for their day to avoid getting overwhelmed or distracted. Having a predictable schedule can help HSPs to feel safe and calm.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Find social support. HSPs can share with trusted friends and family how they are feeling and what challenges they are facing. Even if people don't understand what it is like to be an HSP, they will likely be supportive of their efforts to improve and grow.</li>
