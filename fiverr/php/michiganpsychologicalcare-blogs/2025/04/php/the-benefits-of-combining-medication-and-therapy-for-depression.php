                                <h1><strong>The Benefits of Combining Medication and Therapy for Depression</strong></h1>
                                
                                <p>According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression#:~:text=An%20estimated%203.8%25%20of%20the,stigma%20associated%20with%20mental%20disorders.">World Health Organization</a>, 280 million people struggle with depression worldwide. <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression">Depression</a> is a mood disorder that has symptoms of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in things that the person previously enjoyed doing. If left untreated, depression can take over all areas of a person&rsquo;s life. There are a variety of treatments used for treating depression, but the most common ones are medication and therapy. In most cases, it&rsquo;s recommended to use both medication and therapy together for the best results.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>Benefits of Medication</strong></h2>
                                <p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046273">Psychiatric medications</a> can help treat depression by regulating the chemicals in the brain that affect mood. Most of the medications used to treat depression are either Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin&ndash;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These medications affect mood-balancing chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin. While these medications can help to improve mood, they will not work through core beliefs or trauma. To address the deeper issues behind depression, people may consider adding therapy to their treatment.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>Benefits of Therapy</strong></h2>
                                <p><a href="https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/adults">Therapy</a> is a helpful tool when treating depression because it helps people to create better coping skills and reframe their negative thoughts. Unfortunately, there can be stigmas associated with going to therapy. It&rsquo;s important to remember that there is nothing wrong with going to therapy. Going to therapy is just as important as going to the doctor for a checkup. Therapy allows people to work through past traumas, core beliefs, or any other factors that may be contributing to depression.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>Why Combining Medication and Therapy Works&nbsp;</strong></h2>
                                <p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5244449/#:~:text=The%20study%20demonstrates%20that%20the,only%20small%20to%20moderate%20effects.">Research</a> shows that combining medication and therapy is more effective than either one of the two on their own. Medication can help to improve mood, and this improvement may make the person feel more comfortable in therapy. Using the two together addresses the root causes of depression. Some of the core causes of depression are mood disturbances and negative thought patterns. The combination of therapy and medication can help address both of these things.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>While depression is a common mental health condition worldwide, there is hope for people who struggle with it. Both psychiatric medications and seeing a counselor are great ways to fight the symptoms of depression. However, combining the two will bring the best results for people struggling with depression. Both these treatments will help ensure sustainable recovery and relief from depression&rsquo;s symptoms. The combination of these treatments helps to address the biological and emotional aspects of depression, which can lead to higher chances of recovery.</p>
