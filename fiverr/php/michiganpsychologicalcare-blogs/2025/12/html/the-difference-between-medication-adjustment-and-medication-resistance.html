<h1><strong>The Difference Between Medication Adjustment and Medication Resistance</strong></h1>
<p>Mental health medications can be a powerful addition to a person&rsquo;s treatment plan. However, sometimes the process of finding the correct medication or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032723002239">antidepressants</a> can be challenging. Most psychiatric medications take several weeks to work, which means that adjustment periods can take longer and require more changes. Despite these challenges, mental health medications can be life-saving for people struggling with certain mental health conditions. We will discuss the differences between medication adjustment and medication resistance and how to handle both throughout <a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/treatments/mental-health-medications/">medication management</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Medication Adjustment?</strong></h2>
<p>People take medications for various purposes. In all these cases, medication adjustments will be needed at some point during the process. Everyone who takes medications is different, so the way their bodies respond to the medicines will be different, too. Within psychotic medication management, adjustments are even more common. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8960394/">Psychiatric medications</a> come in different doses, which may have to be changed depending on symptom changes. Adjustments for medications like these are normal and to be expected. They do not mean that the person taking them did anything wrong. Some of the types of medication adjustments are dose changes, dose timing, and monitoring side effects. Adjustments are usually needed because each person&rsquo;s brain chemistry is different.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Medication Resistance?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2024.05.5.12">Medication resistance</a> is when a person&rsquo;s body does not respond to a medication. Medication resistance is usually not declared unless the patient has tried multiple medications. Before someone experiences medication resistance, it&rsquo;s important to make sure that the patient tried the medication for a long enough time, took it consistently, and took the correct dose. Psychiatric professionals can help patients identify and determine medication resistance within patients.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How to Handle Medication Resistance</strong></h2>
<p>Medication resistance and adjustments are to be expected during the early days of treatment. Adjustments will usually help improve treatment outcomes and help prevent medication resistance. Medication resistance signals to psychiatric professionals that a different form of treatment might be needed. We want to remind anyone reading this that medication resistance is not your fault. Patients should always feel empowered to advocate for themselves and ask questions when needed. They can do this through communication and tracking of symptoms and side effects.</p>
<p>Psychiatric care often includes a trial-and-error period. It&rsquo;s important to be patient while undergoing medication adjustments. In most cases, medication adjustments will be needed because it&rsquo;s rare to find the perfect medication on the first try. We understand it can be frustrating when treatment options don&rsquo;t work or aren&rsquo;t as helpful as we thought. But it&rsquo;s important to keep fighting. Finding <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4395546/">mental health treatment</a> that works and recovery is always possible for anyone willing to look for it.&nbsp;</p>
