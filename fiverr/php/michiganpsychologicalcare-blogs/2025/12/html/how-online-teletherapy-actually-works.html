<h1><strong>How Online Teletherapy Actually Works&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>For many years, therapy was only accessible to people who had the time and money to travel to sessions. However, with advancements in technology, people can do therapy online from home. Teletherapy has become a staple in the mental health field and has allowed many people around the world to go to therapy.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Online Teletherapy?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10888081/">Online therapy</a> is a type of therapy that takes place from home, virtually with a licensed professional. When someone is seeking virtual therapy, they will need to find a professional who is licensed in their state. Teletherapy can be either over video sessions or phone calls. Online therapy sessions are HIPAA-compliant and private.</p>
<h2><strong>How Online Teletherapy Sessions Work</strong></h2>
<p>Online therapy sessions follow a similar structure to those in person. They usually start with a check-in and intake process. The next step of therapy is discussing treatment goals and concerns. A typical therapy session can go from anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. If a patient needs longer or more frequent sessions, this can be discussed with their therapist. Teletherapy is a great tool to treat a variety of mental health conditions. In some cases, online therapy may not be appropriate if the patient is in crisis or a critical condition. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/online-talk-therapy-works-as-well-as-an-in-person-session-a-new-study-shows/">Finding an online therapist</a> can take time, but there are free resources, such as <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us</a>, to help with this.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Therapy from Home</strong></h2>

Online therapy also helps provide therapy to areas that might not have other resources. This helps bring mental health care to people in all areas. People with busy work schedules can benefit from online therapy because they fit it into their lives more easily. Teletherapy also helps both the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12211157/">teletherapist</a> and patient feel comfortable within their own spaces.
