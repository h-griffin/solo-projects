<h1><strong>The Psychology of People-Pleasing and How to Unlearn It</strong></h1>
<p>Everyone has basic needs that deserve to be met at all times. However, people who struggle with people-pleasing often have difficulty seeing their own needs as important as those of others. People-pleasing is developed as a survival strategy, not as a flaw or shortcoming. These traits are often rooted in underlying feelings of low self-worth and a fear of losing meaningful connections.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is a People-Pleaser?</strong></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-emotional-meter/202408/the-complexity-of-people-pleasing">people-pleaser</a> is someone who prioritizes the needs of others over the needs of their own. When someone is classified as a people-pleaser, they oftentimes have a difficult time saying no, oftentimes agree to things that they don&rsquo;t actually agree to, avoid conflict, and apologize when they are not at fault. As we mentioned previously, these traits are not character flaws.</p>
<h2><strong>The Psychology Behind People-Pleasing</strong></h2>
<p>People-pleasing is a challenging thing to work through because it is deeply rooted within the person&rsquo;s psyche. When someone experiences people-pleasing, they are likely doing so based on several factors. The first being that people-pleasers fear being rejected or abandoned. When someone struggles with people-pleasing, disapproval can feel like danger. People-pleasing is also deeply rooted in low <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12318589/">self-worth</a> and the seeking of external validation. When someone struggles with people-pleasing, these struggles often attach to self-esteem.</p>
<h2><strong>How People-Pleasing Affects Self-Worth</strong></h2>
<p>People-pleasing affects self-worth because people begin to abandon their own needs and desires for others. When someone struggles with people-pleasing, they will likely also struggle with self-trust. Over time, people-pleasers begin to internalize the belief that their needs are too much or don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How to Unlearn People Pleasing</strong></h2>
<p>People who struggle with people-pleasing likely also struggle with emotional boundaries and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12379063/">assertiveness</a>. Assertiveness is a powerful form of communication that can be difficult for people-pleasers to navigate. Being assertive is not mean but important to maintain boundaries that protect the well-being of all parties in the relationship. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5868552/">Emotional boundaries</a> are important to understanding that taking care of our own needs must come first. When people are unlearning people-pleasing behaviors, they will often feel guilty after saying no. This does not mean that they are wrong; it&rsquo;s just an example of how deeply these issues are rooted. Another way that people can start to unlearn people-pleasing is to reconnect with their own <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X23000037">needs</a>. People can try identifying their own personal values and try scheduling activities that include them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People-pleasing is a learned behavior that developed for specific reasons. Unlearning people-pleasing is important for the person&rsquo;s safety and well-being, but it&rsquo;s not about being selfish. People who struggle with people-pleasing can work through reframing assertiveness as a way to preserve connection, not bring danger to it. It&rsquo;s important for people-pleasers to remember that their needs are not too much or invalid. They are just as valid as everyone else&rsquo;s needs. When people unlearn people-pleasing, they will need to work through strengthening their self-worth and taking care of their own needs. This can be challenging, but it is always worth the effort. Everyone&rsquo;s needs are valid, even if they don&rsquo;t always feel that way.</p>
