<h1>What Happens in a Therapy Session? A Beginner's Guide</h1>
<p>Therapy is a powerful tool in treating mental health conditions and working through difficult life changes. Unfortunately, there are still stigmas related to starting <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5509639/">therapy</a>. In our society, people often treat physical ailments as more important than mental ones. But this is not the case. Mental health is an important aspect of our overall well-being. Therapy can help equip us with the tools and knowledge needed to maintain a life free of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3330564/">mental health</a> symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Start Therapy?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, therapy helps create a safe, unbiased place for people to talk about and learn from things they have gone through. Therapy also serves as an opportunity to learn coping skills that will help people live happier and healthier lives. It can be scary to start therapy for the first time if people don&rsquo;t know what to expect.</p>
<h2>Types of Therapy</h2>
<p>The main structures of <a href="https://mhanational.org/resources/science-behind-therapy/">therapy sessions</a> are in-office, tele-therapy, and group therapy. The most common type of therapy is in-office therapy. On the other hand, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38190285/">teletherapy</a> is therapy that takes place virtually over video or phone calls with an online counselor. This type of therapy involves a teletherapist and a patient in a virtual setting. This form of therapy is a convenient way for people to fit therapy into their busy lives. The other type of therapy format is group therapy. Group therapy is led by a licensed professional, and group members can provide each other with peer support.</p>
<h2>Therapy Session Format</h2>
<p>All therapy sessions will be a little different because each person is different in their own way. In general, there are several things that occur during most therapy sessions. We hope that this information helps readers feel more comfortable with the therapeutic experience. The first step of any therapy relationship is the intake process. The intake process involves going through logistical items such as insurance or paperwork. However, it also involves the therapist getting to know their patient. This might involve discussing previous diagnoses or experiences that the patient might have gone through. This part of <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2012/08/psychotherapy-effective">therapy</a> will also serve as the patient&rsquo;s opportunity to discuss what brought them into therapy. After this, therapists might work with patients to set goals and work through their struggles.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of attending therapy is maintaining an open mind. Being open to new ways of thinking or seeing the world will make therapy even more effective. Finding a therapist can be a challenging task because everyone has a unique perspective on things. There is nothing wrong with having to try several therapists before finding the right fit. Most therapists understand this process and will understand it&rsquo;s not a personal decision. Having a therapist who understands you can make all the difference when approaching therapy sessions.&nbsp;</p>
