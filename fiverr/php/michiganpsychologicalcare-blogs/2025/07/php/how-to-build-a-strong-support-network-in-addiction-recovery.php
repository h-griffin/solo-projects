                                <p>Strong support networks are a helpful part of addiction recovery. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7215253/">Addiction recovery</a> can feel lonely and isolating. When someone is going through recovery, they might not always be strong enough to fight their addictions. Leaning on friends, family, or support groups is a great way to help with recovery. September is National Recovery Month, and we wanted to use this opportunity to share some tips for building a support network when healing from addiction.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Why Support Matters in Addiction Recovery</strong></h3>
                                <p>Addiction Recovery is most effective when it includes social support as a part of treatment. This can be through interpersonal relationships or a group therapy setting, such as <a href="https://www.aa.org/">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. With support, people in recovery can use accountability to help them from acting on their addiction. It&rsquo;s most helpful to have support networks that include personal and professional people.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3><strong>Steps to Build a Support Network</strong></h3>
                                <p>Building a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4375072/">support network</a> might take time and resources, but it&rsquo;s always possible to do.</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Identify what you need in recovery. This could be accountability, new coping skills, or emotional support. By identifying these needs, you can figure out how to ask for support in the right areas. You may also decide that you need a therapist or psychiatrist as a part of your treatment team.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Have conversations with people in your personal life about your recovery and ask them to support you. In most cases, if these people are supportive in your life, they will be willing to help in the best way they can.</p>
                                <p>Step 3: Reach out to professionals. Find a therapist either in person or through <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13722-015-0035-4">teletherapy</a> to help you work through your recovery. Therapy is a great way to get to the root causes of why addictions were created to begin with.</p>
                                <p>Step 4: Look for <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6289265/">group therapy</a> or meetings. Many group therapy groups are available to people struggling with their mental health. Some of these include Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and SMART Recovery. These resources can provide peer support and help people feel less alone.</p>
                                <p>Step 5: Continue communicating with your support network and make changes if needed. As much as people mean well, sometimes the right fit is different for each person. This is the case for building a support network in addiction recovery. Sometimes people who are trying to support you are unable to do it for whatever reason. This is okay. Finding new people to provide support would be the next step to strengthening your team.</p>
                                <p>Building support networks is an ongoing and continuous process in recovery. Addiction recovery is most successful when people lean on others to support them, especially in the early stages of recovery. Addiction recovery can be incredibly difficult, and relapses may happen. But having a strong support network means that you always have people to rely on when you take a few steps. Support networks can help comfort you and help you get back on track with recovery.</p>
