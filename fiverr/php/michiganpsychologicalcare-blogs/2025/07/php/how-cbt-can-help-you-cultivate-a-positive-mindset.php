                                <p>Positive thinking will not cure mental health conditions. However, having a positive mindset can lead to improvements in mental health symptoms, mood, and self-esteem. Shifting one's mindset can help us become more confident and productive both at work and at home. Cultivating a positive mindset requires consistency and practice.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>What Is CBT?</strong></h2>
                                <p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8489050/">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a> (CBT) is a type of therapy that is commonly used to treat anxiety and depression. CBT is a proven method to help reframe distorted thoughts and replace them with more positive ones. This type of therapy helps teach patients how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interconnected. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3584580/">CBT</a> can help improve negative mindsets, which can improve all areas of a person&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Using CBT to Develop a Positive Mindset</strong></h3>
                                <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a powerful tool to use when a person is trying to reframe their thoughts. Several of the skills taught in CBT encourage <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30897464/">mindset shifts</a> in a person&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Thought Records: One of the tools taught in CBT is the use of thought records. These records try to track situations and triggers, and the thoughts and emotions that follow. Understanding how our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors work together is a powerful way for people to improve their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21819813/">mental health</a>. <br /><br /></li>
                                    <li>Reframing: Learning how to reframe our thoughts is a helpful skill that CBT teaches. Reframing exercises help people identify <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4991044/">cognitive distortions</a> in their thinking. Cognitive distortions are defined as inaccurate, negative thinking patterns that are not directly reflected in reality. Once we are able to identify the cognitive distortions we may have adopted, we can begin to reframe our thoughts to be more accurate and helpful.<br /><br /></li>
                                    <li>Behavioral Activation: Behavioral activation is a practice taught in CBT that encourages people to engage in activities that have the potential to improve their mood. This tool helps people cultivate a positive mindset because an improved mood will naturally make people think more positively. Just like when we are in a negative mood, our mindset might be leaning negatively</li>
                                    <li>Gratitude: Practicing gratitude has been proven to help with a positive mood and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10393216/">positive thinking</a>. Having a gratitude practice can also lead to other mental health benefits, such as reduced stress and anxiety.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Having a positive mindset is transformative in improving our physical and mental health. While this is true, it is also true that it can be hard to develop a positive mindset if it is not what you are used to. Changing our thought patterns and beliefs about ourselves takes time, effort, and consistency.&nbsp; Having a positive outlook on the world improves our own mood and hopefully inspires others to do the same. We understand that thinking positively is a lot easier said than done. But we also know that cultivating a positive mindset is possible for anyone willing to put the time into practicing it.&nbsp;</p>
