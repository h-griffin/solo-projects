<h2><strong>Take Care of Your Physical Health</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, your physical health plays a significant role in your mental wellbeing. Adding some physical health goals to your new year&rsquo;s resolutions will benefit both your physical and mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>Exercise More Often</strong></h3>
<p>Exercise has been associated with many mental health benefits, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.">lower anxiety levels, fewer feelings of depression, a boosted mood, improved self-esteem, and better cognitive functioning</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Eat Enough and Eat Nutritiously</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever heard of the term &ldquo;hangry&rdquo;? There&rsquo;s a reason that term has come to be. When your body does not have the nutrients it needs to function, your mental health will begin to suffer. The foods you eat matter, too. Whole foods with fiber, antioxidants, folate, vitamin D, magnesium, and probiotics have all been suggested to improve one&rsquo;s overall wellbeing.</p>
<h3><strong>Develop Good Sleep Hygiene</strong></h3>
<p>Your sleep plays a crucial role in your mental health and overall wellbeing. Sleep allows your brain to rest and recuperate, so you can wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. Those who do not get enough high-quality sleep may struggle with low moods and negative thoughts. A lack of sleep has also been associated with a higher risk of developing a mental health disorder. To improve your sleep this year, a few resolutions you can make include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling a regular sleep schedule</li>
<li>Avoiding screens and dimming lights up to an hour before bedtime</li>
<li>Developing a relaxing night routine to help you wind down</li>
<li>Exposing yourself to natural light as much as possible during the daytime</li>
<li>Exercising regularly</li>
<li>Investing in high-quality bedding, mattress, and pillows to ensure you are comfortable in your sleep</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Nurture and Build Relationships with Others</strong></h2>
<p>Social relationships significantly affect a person&rsquo;s mental health and wellbeing. Those with healthy social relationships tend to experience lower stress levels,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/savvy/press/JHSB_March_2012_Idler_News_Release.pdf">higher resilience</a>&nbsp;to both mental and physical health struggles, a greater sense of purpose, higher self-esteem, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/425958/">live longer</a>! This year, make a resolution to build stronger, healthier relationships. You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<h2><strong>Practice Mindfulness More Often</strong></h2>
<p>Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present at the moment you are currently living in, without judgment or ridicule. The act of mindfulness has been associated with many mental health benefits, including granting one clarity in their thoughts, becoming more emotionally intelligent, stress relief, improved social health, and greater resilience to negative thoughts and emotions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Making an effort to notice your surroundings in everyday life</li>
<li>Taking a mindful walk</li>
<li>Sitting and observing your thoughts without judgment</li>
<li>Mindfulness meditation</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What is Mindfulness Meditation?</strong></h3>
<p>Mindfulness meditation is a meditative practice in which one slows down their thoughts and brings them to the present moment, lets go of judgment and ridicule, and focuses on relaxing the mind and body. The benefits of this practice are so great that it has been a tool used to help many cognitive therapy patients work through their mental health struggles.</p>
<h2><strong>Make Gratitude a Priority</strong></h2>
<p>Gratitude allows us to focus on the positive aspects of our every day, granting us a more optimistic outlook on our lives. Those who practice gratitude have found themselves experiencing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier#:~:text=In%20positive%20psychology%20research%2C%20gratitude,adversity%2C%20and%20build%20strong%20relationships.">more positive emotions, enjoying the happy moments of life more, improved physical health and mental wellbeing, stronger relationships, and greater resilience to tough times</a>.

<h2><strong>Decrease Your Screen Time</strong></h2>

This year, consider setting stricter boundaries around your screen time to allow you to enjoy your life more fully.</p>
<h2><strong>Build a Healthy Work/ Life Balance</strong></h2>
<p>All work and no play can certainly begin to take its toll on anyone&rsquo;s mental health. Those who struggle to create a healthy work-life balance may find themselves struggling with burnout. This year, resolve to separate your work and home life more efficiently. You can do so by:</p>
