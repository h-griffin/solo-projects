<h1><strong>What to Do if You Feel Worthless</strong></h1>
<p>Feeling worthless can be deeply upsetting, impacting every aspect of your life, like your relationships, confidence,
    work, and happiness. There are many reasons a person may feel worthless. It may be thanks to past experiences, low
    mood, or something else.</p>
<p>Regardless of why you feel worthless, it is important to address it and do what you can to change that idea. Here are
    a few things to do to improve your mental health when you are feeling worthless.</p>
<h2><strong>Acknowledge Your Feelings</strong></h2>
<p>Allow yourself a chance to explore your feelings without judgment. It is perfectly normal to experience negative
    thoughts or feelings from time to time. Acknowledge your feelings and know that they do not define you or your life.
</p>
<h2><strong>Challenge Negative Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Feeling worthless can become a mindset. When your thoughts are emphasizing your feelings of worthlessness, you will
    find it hard to overcome them. Work to become more aware of these negative thoughts and challenge them with more
    balanced, healthy perspectives. Remind yourself of all of your best traits, strengths, and accomplishments.</p>
<h2><strong>Address Your Triggers</strong></h2>
<p>Are there certain thoughts, situations, or people that trigger or emphasize your feelings of worthlessness?
    Understanding your triggers allows you the chance to set boundaries, better prepare, and overcome
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h2><strong>Treat Yourself Like a Friend</strong></h2>
<p>Be kind and gentle with yourself. When your loved ones fail or make a mistake, do you berate them or do you practice
    compassion for them? You deserve that same loving treatment you give to your friends. Speak positively to yourself,
    learn from your mistakes and move forward, and practice self-care to show yourself love and kindness.</p>
<h2><strong>Set Attainable Goals</strong></h2>
<p>Set small, obtainable goals. Every time you succeed in reaching these goals will lead to a heightened sense of
    self-worth and accomplishment. Keeping the goals small and attainable allows you to chase that feeling of
    accomplishment without excessive pressure. Simply break down your big goals, dreams, and passions into smaller, more
    achievable goals.</p>
<h2><strong>Do Things That Bring You Feelings of Joy</strong></h2>
<p>Find activities and hobbies that bring you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose. Whether it involves spending
    time in nature, arts and crafts, volunteering, or spending time with loved ones, prioritizing activities that leave
    you feeling joyful and fulfilled can be essential in building your self-worth.</p>
<h2><strong>Give Affirmations a Try</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814782/">Positive affirmations</a> are research-backed ways of
    improving one&rsquo;s confidence, self-worth, and quality of life. Take some time to speak positive, loving words to
    yourself every day.</p>
<h2><strong>Talk to Someone</strong></h2>
<p>Social support can be critical in maintaining resilience against negative thoughts, stress, and feelings of
    worthlessness. Reach out to a trusted loved one for support as you navigate these difficult feelings. Their love and
    support can be crucial to helping you feel better.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Seek Professional Help</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most important things you can do for yourself when feeling worthless is to seek the help of a mental
    health professional. Feelings of worthlessness, especially when paired with other symptoms like a low mood, lack of
    motivation, and social isolation, could indicate that something more serious is going on with your mental health,
    like depression.</p>
