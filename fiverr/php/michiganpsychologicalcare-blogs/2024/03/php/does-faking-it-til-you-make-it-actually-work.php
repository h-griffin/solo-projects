                                <p>We have all heard the saying, &ldquo;Fake it &lsquo;til you make it.&rdquo; This has been applied to a wide array of events, such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Moments when we are in need of confidence</li>
                                    <li>Times we are feeling low but wish to find joy again</li>
                                    <li>Moments we are in search of motivation</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Sure, in theory, &ldquo;fake it &lsquo;til you make it&rsquo; sounds like a pretty solid piece of advice. Surely we will eventually begin feeling the emotions we are faking&hellip; right? In today&rsquo;s article, we are covering just how effective this piece of advice can be.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2><strong>What Does it Mean to &ldquo;Fake it &lsquo;Til You Make It&rdquo;?</strong></h2>
                                <p>&ldquo;Fake it &lsquo;til you make it&rdquo; refers to the idea of projecting the feelings you wish to experience until you actually feel them. The idea is based on the thought that pretending to possess the feelings or skills you wish to possess will allow you the confidence, appearance, and motivation to begin feeling and acting that way in reality.</p>
                                <p>This is applied to skills, emotions, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8807854/">mental health</a>, and thoughts about oneself. An example of &ldquo;faking it &lsquo;til you make it&rdquo; involves imagining yourself on your first day of work. You may not possess all of the skills or confidence needed to complete the job. However, you eventually will. The idea of &ldquo;fake it &lsquo;til you make it&rsquo; is that if you pretend to possess the skills needed in your workplace and the confidence in yourself to exhibit those skills, you will eventually possess them.</p>
                                <p>For some people, this approach can be extremely effective. For others, however, it may not.</p>
                                <h2><strong>How Effective is Faking It &lsquo;Til You Make It?</strong></h2>
                                <p>While it may not always work, faking it &lsquo;til you make it has become such a popular piece of advice for good reason. In the right scenarios, this approach can be extremely effective for making a person feel happier, more confident, and more motivated to improve their skill set.</p>
                                <p>So, when is the best time to fake it &lsquo;til you make it? The best time to utilize this piece of advice is when you are looking to change your external behaviors, not who you are on the inside. For example, some great opportunities to fake it &lsquo;til you make it could include exhibiting more confidence in yourself for a date than you have, pretending to be more productive at work, or pretending to be happier than you are by engaging in behaviors that spark joy.</p>
                                <p>The idea is that &ldquo;faking it&rdquo; by exhibiting external behaviors of possessing the qualities you are looking to possess will lead to habits, routines, and behaviors that allow you to actually possess those qualities.</p>
