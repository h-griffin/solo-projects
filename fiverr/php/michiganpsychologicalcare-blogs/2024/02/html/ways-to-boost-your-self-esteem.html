<h2><strong>Ways to Boost Your Self-Esteem</strong></h2>
<p>Self-esteem has many benefits to offer. However, it doesn&rsquo;t always come quickly. There are a few ways one can boost their self-esteem, including:</p>
<h3><strong>Showing Yourself Some Compassion</strong></h3>
<p>Have you heard the saying, &ldquo;You are your own worst critic&rdquo;? If you have, the chances are high that you tend to be harsh on yourself, emphasizing your mistakes and criticizing everything about yourself.</p>
<p>Showing yourself compassion is a key component of building self-esteem. When you primarily focus on the negatives, it can be difficult to find the positive aspects of yourself. The next time you make a mistake or find a flaw within yourself, show yourself some love and kindness rather than tearing yourself down. Over time, you will find that your overall view of yourself improves vastly.</p>
<h3><strong>Recognize the Positives</strong></h3>
<p>Your mindset impacts your view of your life and yourself. Consciously seeking to recognize the positives through practices like gratitude will vastly improve your perspective on the world and, ultimately, yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Practice Self-Care</strong></h3>
<p>Taking care of yourself plays a significant role in your mental and physical health, which can impact your self-esteem. Self-care can be deeply personal, differing greatly from person to person. A few ideas for self-care include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Staying active</li>
    <li>Maintaining good hygiene</li>
    <li>Getting enough sleep&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Spending time outside</li>
    <li>Eating healthy and nutritious foods</li>
    <li>Making time for hobbies you enjoy</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Set Small Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Achieving goals can be a great way to view yourself in a more positive light. It&rsquo;s great to have big goals for your life. However, breaking these goals into smaller, more achievable ones will leave you feeling motivated to continue chasing your dream while building confidence and self-esteem.</p>
<h3><strong>Give Positive Affirmations a Try</strong></h3>
<p>Positive affirmations involve speaking positive things about yourself aloud. While it may feel a bit ridiculous at first, affirmations have been shown to have many benefits to offer a person, including building confidence, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6931103/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20we%20conclude%20that%20reinstating,the%20powerless%20and%20the%20powerful.">boosting cognitive performance</a>, and boosting mood.</p>
