                                <h1><strong>Ways to Make Happiness Happen</strong></h1>
    
                                <p>Happiness Happens Day is on August 8th, a day meant to celebrate the presence of happiness, whether we feel it right now or not. Happiness is so much more than a fleeting emotion; it is a key aspect of the quality of a person's current mental health and overall well-being.</p>
                                <h2><strong>The Connection Between Happiness and Mental Health</strong></h2>
                                <p>Happiness and mental health tend to be closely related. When you find yourself in a positive emotional state, your mental health and resilience is significantly improved. On the other hand, struggling mental health will greatly impact one's ability to experience happiness. Focusing on strategies to boost your mental health can be instrumental to making happiness a more consistent part of your life.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Ways to Make Happiness Happen</strong></h2>
                                <p>A few ways you can make happiness happen include:</p>
                                <h3><strong>Work on Your Mindset with Therapy</strong></h3>
                                <p>Therapy, including methods like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), can be a great way to boost your mental health and foster feelings of happiness. CBT helps clients become aware of and change paths away from negative thinking patterns and behaviors that contribute to pessimistic thinking and unhappiness.</p>
                                <p>Mindfully changing these thoughts and adopting healthier coping techniques can significantly boost mental wellness and, ultimately, happiness. Therapy can provide the support and tools you need to effectively manage feelings of stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Practice Mindfulness</strong></h3>
                                <p>Mindfulness is a powerful practice for boosting positive thinking and happiness. Focusing on the present moment and working to accept it without judgment is a great way to reduce stress and enhance your mental wellness. Mindfulness can help a person cultivate peace and gratitude for the moment they are in; a great tool for increasing happiness.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Build Strong Social Connections</strong></h3>
                                <p>Humans are a social species, and building strong social networks is a key player in making happiness happen. Making time to be with friends and family can build your mental health and boost your happiness.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Get Physical</strong></h3>
                                <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369812/">Exercise</a> has many benefits aside from the aesthetics. Getting your body moving can boost endorphins, otherwise known as the &ldquo;happy hormones&rdquo;, sending physical happiness through your body.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Set Achievable Goals</strong></h3>
                                <p>Achievement can be so encouraging, sending many people into feelings of happiness and joy. Set goals that you know you can achieve, like starting a new hobby or writing a rough draft for that book you always dreamed of.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Practice Gratitude</strong></h2>
                                <p>While it might seem easier said than done, gratitude is a critical part to feeling happy and it is easier to achieve than you may think. Work to focus on the things you are grateful for in life. Thank people out loud more often. Keep a gratitude journal. Focusing on the things you are grateful for can shift your perspective away from seeking what is lacking to seeking the blessings in your life.</p>
