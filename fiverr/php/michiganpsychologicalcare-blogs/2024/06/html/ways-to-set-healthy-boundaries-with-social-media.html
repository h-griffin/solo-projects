<h3><strong>Positive Impacts of Social Media:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Connection and Support</strong>: Social media is a great platform for connecting with others, providing a sense of belonging and support, and alleviating feelings of isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing &amp; Spreading Information</strong>: Social media platforms can be highly effective for sharing and spreading information.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Education and Awareness</strong>: Social media can efficiently educate people on many topics. For instance, it can raise awareness of mental health conditions, promote self-care practices, and provide access to resources and professional help.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Negative Impacts:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Constant exposure to curated and idealized highlight reels of other people&rsquo;s lifestyles can lead to negative self-comparison, which can quickly lead to feelings of inadequacy and envy, contributing to lower self-esteem.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyberbullying</strong>: Social media can act as a platform for cyberbullying, harassment, and trolling. This can quickly begin to significantly impact mental health and well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Unrealistic Expectations</strong>: From filters to highlight reels, social media can set unrealistic expectations for impressionable minds.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Addiction</strong>: Scrolling can be an addictive habit, with notifications and the fear of missing out (FOMO) reeling users ready for a break back in.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the impact social media has on mental health can vary widely depending on a person&rsquo;s usage patterns, consumption, and insecurities and vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mindful use and healthy boundaries are crucial for healthy social media use.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How to Set Healthy Boundaries with Social Media</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Setting healthy boundaries with social media can help mitigate its potentially negative impacts on mental health. A few ways to set these boundaries include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Setting Limits</strong>: Decide how much time you want to be spending on social media and figure out strategies for maintaining them.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Establish Tech-Free Zones</strong>: Have a designated area or time zone in which social media is completely off-limits.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Keep Your Feed Inspiring</strong>: Ensure that you are following and consuming content that leaves you feeling better. If you find yourself feeling down after scrolling, unfollow the accounts leading to those feelings.&nbsp;</li>
