                                <h1><strong>Can Tele-therapy Help You Make a Career Decision?</strong></h1>
    
                                <p>Making decisions in life can be challenging regardless of whether the decision is big or small. When you are making decisions (especially big ones), it can be a difficult task. We always want to make sure we are making the &ldquo;right&rdquo; decision. But little do we know that the right decision looks different for everyone!&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>For people who struggle with anxiety or high-stress levels, making decisions is even more difficult. Often, these people will second guess their decisions, procrastinate making decisions, or will overall refuse to make them. Tele-therapy can be a helpful thing to add to your decision-making routine. This includes making decisions about your career.</p>
                                <p>We work for a large portion of our lives, so it is imperative that we find jobs that we enjoy (or at least can tolerate). It can be normal to feel stress when making decisions about your career because we want to make a choice that will ensure our success.</p>
                                <p>One way that we can help our decision-making journey is by looking for online mental health video counseling. Tele-therapy can provide important skills and support in making important life decisions. Online counseling is a convenient way to fit therapy into your busy schedule. The great thing about starting online therapy is you can find therapists that are licensed in your state specifically. There are many to choose from to ensure you find the best fit possible.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Help you work through many of life&rsquo;s challenges. This can include mental health struggles, relationship support, and even career counseling. <br /><br /></li>
                                    <li>Help you define your core values. Your values can be a helpful tool to steer your career search. For example, if one of your values is creativity, you could try to find a job that incorporates creativity in its daily job description. In addition to determining your values, tele-health therapy can help you set and maintain goals. Having your counselor can help hold you accountable for goals or changes.<br /><br /></li>
                                    <li>Help you gain confidence to apply for higher positions or promotion opportunities. You can learn different ways to improve your confidence. This can be affirmations, positive self-talk, and other CBT skills. <br /><br /></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>CBT stands for cognitive behavioral therapy and is a type of counseling that targets unhelpful thinking patterns or distortions. CBT also involves working on the patient&rsquo;s unhelpful behaviors. In regard to career decisions, CBT can help to understand and rewrite unhelpful thoughts you may have about your abilities to get a certain job or position. Online video counseling can also provide a space to role-play interviews or other stressful career-related situations.&nbsp;</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>We understand that making decisions about your career can be difficult, but it is possible to find something that you enjoy and that uses the skills you have. It can be overwhelming to start the journey to find your ideal career. However, taking the time to find something you feel passionate about or finding something that showcases your unique skills will pay off in the long run. If you are ready to look into working with a therapist, we are here for you.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michiganpsychologicalcare.com/contact.php">Contact</a>&nbsp;us today.</p>
