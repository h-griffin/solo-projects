                            <ul>
                                <li>Offering flexible remote work opportunities when possible</li>
                                <li>Asking managers to place their focus on productivity rather than hours</li>
                                <li>Encouraging employees to take breaks throughout the workday</li>
                                <li>Keeping workloads achievable</li>
                                <li>Encouraging employees to take time off from work</li>

                            <h3><strong>Give Your Employees Volunteer Opportunities</strong></h3>
