                                <h2><strong>Ways to Improve Your Social Wellness</strong></h2>
                                <p>Just because your social wellness isn&rsquo;t thriving now does not mean you are incapable of being socially healthy. As a matter of fact, healthy social behaviors are something we all learn! If you would like to improve your social wellness, a few ways you can get started include:</p>
                                <h3><strong>Improving Your Relationship with Yourself</strong></h3>
                                <p>Before you start trying to improve your social behaviors and interpersonal relationships, you must first grow and nurture your relationship with yourself. The more comfortable and loving you are with yourself, the more comfortable and loving you can be with the people in your communities.</p>
                                <p>To begin improving your relationship with yourself, you can start with little acts of self-care. Take care of your health by eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Take care of your joy by making time to do the things you love. Take care of your stress levels by setting healthy boundaries with the things that stress you out, like social media or work.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Building New Relationships</strong></h3>
                                <p>We can all feel nervous about meeting new people- no matter how confident we are. However, the more practice you get with meeting new people and building new relationships, the easier it will become to reach out to new people.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Nurturing Old Relationships</strong></h3>
                                <p>When we are struggling with our social health, many of us find ourselves falling into the habit of waiting for others to reach out. Unfortunately, this habit can cause friendships to dwindle and relationships to fizzle out. Every relationship requires effort in order for it to thrive. So, give your mom a call. Ask that old friend if they want to hang out. Be there for your loved one who is hurting. Celebrate your cousin&rsquo;s newest promotions. Let the people you care about know just how much you love them.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Find Some Groups that Match Your Interests</strong></h3>
                                <p>With the internet, it is easier than ever to find groups of people who share similar niche interests as you. Knowing that you share an interest or passion with a group of people can make building a connection easy and leave you feeling like you belong. There are tons of ways to find groups of likeminded people in your community, including through:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Facebook</li>
                                    <li>Community bulletin boards</li>
                                    <li>Church</li>
                                    <li>School</li>
                                    <li>Work</li>
                                    <li>Friend meet-up sites</li>
                                    <li>Volunteering</li>
                                    <li>The gym or workout classes</li>
                                    <li>Art, music, or cooking classes</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3><strong>Practicing the Art of Small Talk</strong></h3>
                                <p>Starting a conversation with a stranger can be incredibly intimidating, especially when you feel like you have no idea what to say. However, making small talk with others is a critical social skill that can help you build and grow new relationships. There are millions of topics you can engage in small talk about, but if you have no idea where to begin, a few small talk topic ideas include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Compliments</li>
                                    <li>Family or pets</li>
                                    <li>Career or jobs</li>
                                    <li>Favorite books or hobbies</li>
                                    <li>Sports</li>
                                    <li>Travel</li>
                                    <li>Music</li>
                                    <li>Food</li>
                                    <li>The day</li>
                                    <li>The weather</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3><strong>Get Out of the House</strong></h3>
                                <p>When you&rsquo;re feeling tired or burnt out, it can be easy to fall into the habit of going straight from work to home, preventing us from having any sort of fun social interactions in our days. If we work from home and fall into this habit, we don&rsquo;t have in-person social interactions at all. Social isolation will take a serious toll on your social health and overall wellbeing. That is why it can be so important to push past your desire to stay home and binge-watch your favorite show alone in bed. Make a goal to leave the house for fun social interactions at least three times per week. You can go on a date. You can have a friend&rsquo;s night out. You can go to a class to learn a new skill. Whatever you decide to do, just get out of the house.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Make Time for In-Person Connection</strong></h3>
                                <p>Technology has made some amazing advancements in our social lives. We now have greater access to loved ones all over the world. We are also able to form online communities and get to know people we never would have met otherwise. There is nothing wrong with using technology to build, nurture, and grow relationships. However, it is important to remember that technology will never replace in-person human interaction. So, while it is great to FaceTime Grandma and send memes back and forth with your significant other, you must also make time to see and connect with your loved ones in the real world.</p>
                                <h2><strong>We Are Here for You</strong></h2>
                                <p>Sometimes, we fall into unhealthy relationships, find ourselves struggling with social anxiety, or develop toxic social behaviors.
