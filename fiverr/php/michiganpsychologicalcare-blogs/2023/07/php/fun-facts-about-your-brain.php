                                <h1><strong>10 Fun Facts About Your Brain</strong></h1>
                                
                                <p>Our brains are incredibly fascinating things that we constantly learn more about every day. The more we learn, the more we want to know. A few fun facts we have learned about the brain over the years include:</p>
                                <h2><strong>The Brain&rsquo;s Storage Potential is Considered to be Essentially Infinite</strong></h2>
                                <p>The human brain contains somewhere around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/">a billion neurons</a>. Each of these neurons can form about 1,000 connections to other neurons, which means there can be over a trillion connections between the neurons, allowing for ample storage capacity within the human brain.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Water Makes Up an Estimated 75% of the Brain</strong></h2>
                                <p>Have you ever experienced brain fog when you were feeling dehydrated? That&rsquo;s because your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-you-water-and-human-body">brain is made up of about 75% water</a>, meaning that, even if you are only a little dehydrated, your brain functioning can be affected.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Humans Actually Use All of Their Brains, Not Just 10% of It</strong></h2>
                                <p>Many of us have heard that we only use 10% of our brains. As a matter of fact, Hollywood has capitalized on this idea through movies like&nbsp;<em>Lucy&nbsp;</em>(2014), a film that depicts a person using all of their brain power. However, research has proven that &ldquo;fact&rdquo; is nothing more than a myth. However, evidence suggests that, throughout a single day, we tend to use our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-people-only-use-10-percent-of-their-brains/">whole brain</a>.</p>
                                <h2><strong>As You Get Older, Your Brain Tends to Get Smaller</strong></h2>
                                <p>As you get older, many parts of you shrink. Your brain is no exception. Research has suggested that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596698/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20widely%20found,age%20particularly%20over%20age%2070.&amp;text=The%20manner%20in%20which%20this%20occurs%20is%20less%20clear.">brain volume and/or weight declines</a>&nbsp;as a person ages at a rate of approximately 5% per decade after reaching the age of 40.</p>
                                <h2><strong>The Average Brain is Estimated to Weigh About Three Pounds</strong></h2>
                                <p>On average, an adult human&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-big-is-the-brain-2794888#:~:text=The%20average%20adult%20human%20brain,is%20around%2015%20centimeters%20long.">brain tends to weigh about three pounds</a>&nbsp;(1300 to 1400 grams). Meanwhile, a newborn baby&rsquo;s brain is estimated to weigh about &frac34; of a pound. That means our brains have a lot of growth to do before reaching full maturity!</p>
                                <h2><strong>The Brain Does Not Reach Full Maturity Until About 25 Years Old</strong></h2>
                                <p>Speaking of our brains reaching full maturity, did you know that your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-7-things-to-know#:~:text=Although%20the%20brain%20stops%20growing,the%20last%20parts%20to%20mature.">brain will not reach full maturity</a>&nbsp;until your mid-to-late 20s? One of the final areas of the brain to mature is the prefrontal cortex.</p>
                                <h2><strong>The Brain Can Transmit Information At Speeds Up to 268 Miles Per Hour</strong></h2>
                                <p>Signals along the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/numbers-the-nervous-system-from-268-mph-signals-to-trillions-of-synapses">alpha motor neuron</a>, which sends information to and from the brain, are estimated to travel at the incredible speed of up to 268 miles per hour!</p>
                                <h2><strong>Your Brain is Made up of Nearly 60% Fat</strong></h2>
                                <p>The brain is very fatty, being made up of&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20329590/">nearly 60% fat</a>. That makes it the fattiest part of the human body!</p>
                                <h2><strong>Men&rsquo;s Brains Tend to Be Larger Than Women&rsquo;s</strong></h2>
                                <p>After considering body weight differences, the average&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-big-is-the-brain-2794888#:~:text=The%20average%20adult%20human%20brain,is%20around%2015%20centimeters%20long.">male brain</a>&nbsp;is about 100 grams larger than the average female brain.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Women&rsquo;s Hippocampus Tends to Be Larger Than Men&rsquo;s</strong></h2>
                                <p>While men may tend to have a bigger brain, women tend to have a larger&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6235970/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20women%20have%20larger,connectivity%20%5B42%E2%80%9345%5D.">hippocampus</a>, the part of the brain most often associated with learning and memory.</p>
                                <p>Isn&rsquo;t the brain a fascinating thing? It is also something worth caring for. Part of maintaining a healthy brain includes caring for our mental health.
