<h1><strong>Why Do People Leave Therapy Before They&rsquo;re Ready?</strong></h1>
<p>Therapy can be incredibly valuable, whether you are struggling with complex and difficult feelings, need to build your communication and interpersonal skills, experiencing mental health struggles, working to find your place in the world, or just looking for somebody to talk to that you can trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people, an estimated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774713/">one-fifth per year</a>, leave therapy before they are ready. This could be for a wide variety of reasons. They may feel better and think their therapist&rsquo;s work is done. The cost of treatment may keep them away. Therapy may be more difficult than they ever imagined. Or, maybe they have a completely different reason for leaving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to be covering these reasons for leaving therapy too early in-depth and give you options to consider before you leave therapy too soon.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why People Are Leaving Therapy Too Soon</strong></h2>
<p>There are many reasons people may leave therapy too soon, like:</p>
<h3><strong>Cost and Accessibility</strong></h3>
<p>When therapy is difficult to access, whether due to cost, scheduling conflicts, or lack of convenient location, clients will be more likely to drop out of treatment too soon.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>It Isn&rsquo;t What They Expected</strong></h3>
<p>Some people may find themselves quitting therapy because it is more difficult than they imagine. Others may have thought they would experience change in a different or quicker way. When therapy does not look like a client thought it would, they might feel that it isn&rsquo;t working for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Seeing a Therapist That isn&rsquo;t a Good Fit</strong></h3>
<p>Finding the right therapist is crucial to a good therapy experience. If a person is seeing a therapist who does not understand them, can&rsquo;t build a connection, or whose therapy technique does not work for them, they may give up on the prospect of counseling altogether.</p>
<h3><strong>Resistance</strong></h3>
<p>While a person may not realize it, they may have some qualms about therapy that are causing them to resist giving it a proper try. This will prevent them from seeing any progress, which may lead to them quitting too soon.</p>
<h2><strong>What You Should Consider Before Leaving Therapy</strong></h2>
<p>Before you leave therapy, you want to ensure you have given it a real chance. Therapy can have some amazing benefits when seen through all the way. Before you decide to quit, a few things you may wish to consider include:</p>
<h3><strong>Talking to Your Therapist</strong></h3>
<p>Addressing your thoughts and concerns with your therapist may be just what you need to get your treatment back on track. If you are having problems with your therapy or wondering if you have received all the benefits you can, your therapist will be able to help you make an educated decision on your treatment.</p>
<h3><br /><strong>Trying a New Therapist</strong></h3>
<p>If you are thinking about quitting because you are struggling to trust and connect with your therapist, it is important to know that there is nothing wrong with switching mental health professionals. Every counselor will be different, which means it may take some trial and error to find one who is a good fit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Your Goals for Therapy</strong></h3>
<p>Have you reached your goals for therapy? Is there something in particular you would like to address before quitting? Consider your goals for therapy and discuss them with your therapist before quitting.</p>
