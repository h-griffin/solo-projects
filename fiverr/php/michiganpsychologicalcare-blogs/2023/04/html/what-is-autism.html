<h1>What is Autism?</h1>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/press-release/autism-speaks-pledges-make-world-difference-autism-prevalence-rises-27-children-us">Autism Speaks</a>&nbsp;organization, autism, otherwise known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is estimated to impact 1 in 36 U.S. children today. Considering the significant number of individuals impacted by the developmental health condition, raising awareness is crucial. This is why we are choosing to use our platform to educate people about ASD this World Autism Awareness Day.</p>
<h2><strong>The Definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental health disorder that defines a wide range of social challenges, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>repetitive behaviors</li>
    <li>speech issues</li>
    <li>nonverbal communication struggles</li>
</ul>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a broad term used to define many different developmental health issues. The reason ASD is considered a spectrum disorder is because those experiencing it tend to have a specific set of strengths and limitations. Like many other disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder tends to effect individuals in varying severity, with some experiencing mild symptoms and others more severe.</p>
<h2><strong>Signs and Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>The earlier one is able to seek treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder, the greater chance they have of a successful intervention. The signs of autism typically begin to show around the age of two and can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>not hitting developmental milestones, like making eye contact or smiling by six months, babbling by twelve months, or speaking at least a few words by sixteen months</li>
    <li>avoiding eye contact</li>
    <li>losing speech, babbling, or social skills</li>

    <li>constant repetition of certain words or phrases</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How You Can Raise Awareness About Autism in Your Community</strong></h2>
