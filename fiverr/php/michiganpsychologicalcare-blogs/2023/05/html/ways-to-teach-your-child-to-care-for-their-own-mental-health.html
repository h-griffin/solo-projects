<h1><strong>Ways to Teach Your Child to Care for Their Own Mental Health</strong></h1>
<p>Childhood is a critical time for your little one&rsquo;s health and wellbeing. When their mental health struggles, their growth, maturity, and development will struggle, as well. That is why this National Children&rsquo;s Mental Health Awareness Day, we want to take the time to provide some tips and tricks to help your child begin caring for their mental health today. A few ways you can teach your child about caring for their mental health include:</p>
<h2><strong>Modeling Good Self-Care Habits</strong></h2>
<p>Your little ones are always looking to you for direction. They develop their own mental health habits, self-image, and view of the world by looking to the adults in their life. You are your child&rsquo;s greatest role model, which is why it is so important that you <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/caring-for-your-mental-health">take care of your mental health,</a> too. A few ways you can do this include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keeping your self-talk positive</li>
    <li>Taking a break when you need one</li>
    <li>Caring for your physical health through what you eat, exercise, and getting enough sleep</li>
    <li>Picking up some relaxing hobbies</li>
    <li>Practicing gratitude</li>
    <li>Building healthy relationships with the people around you</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Allowing a Safe Space for Emotions</strong></h2>
<p>It is critical to your child&rsquo;s well-being that they feel safe to open up to you about what they feel stressed over, difficult emotions they are experiencing, or things they need a listening ear or guiding voice about. A few ways you can create a safe space for your child&rsquo;s emotions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Listening with empathy and without judgment</li>
    <li>Validating their feelings and offering support in the way they need it most</li>
    <li>Keeping communication open (especially with topics that may be uncomfortable)</li>
    <li>Learn to recognize when your child is seeking connection</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Taking Some Time to Check in with Them</strong></h2>
<p>With the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it can be easy for your child to feel lost in the shuffle. Try to remember to check in with them often. Ask them how they are feeling, if anything is bothering them, and if they need any support. As you ask, try to really listen to their answers. This will allow you the chance to help them through stressful moments and support them through rough life events.</p>
<h2><strong>Emphasizing the Importance of Taking Care of Their Physical Health</strong></h2>
<p>Physical health plays a huge role in maintaining and caring for one&rsquo;s mental health. Emphasize just how important your child&rsquo;s physical well-being is by helping them develop healthy habits to carry throughout their life, like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Getting movement in whenever they can</li>
    <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
    <li>Eating enough and eating nutritiously</li>
    <li>Going to the doctor when needed</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Practicing Healthy Coping Skills</strong></h2>
<p>There are many ways we all choose to cope with mental struggles. Some are healthier and more effective than others. Teaching your child healthy ways to cope with stress, anger, overwhelm, and other big emotions can be incredibly beneficial to their well-being. A few healthy coping skills to teach can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Breathwork</li>
    <li>Meditation</li>
    <li>Gratitude journaling</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Talking to a friend</li>
