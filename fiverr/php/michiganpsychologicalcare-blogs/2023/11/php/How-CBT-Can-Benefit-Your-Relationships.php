                                <h1><strong>How CBT Can Benefit Your Relationships</strong></h1>
                                
                                <p>When you are seeking mental health help, you aren't only benefiting yourself but the people you love and interact with every day, as well. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of talk therapy that helps you combat mental health issues by changing your thinking and behavioral patterns.</p>
                                <h2><strong>How CBT Can Benefit Your Relationships</strong></h2>
                                <p>When you take control of your mental health through methods like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), you will find that your relationships significantly improve. When you are in a healthier place mentally, you can take better care of the relationships that mean the world to you. Hopping into CBT can help your relationships in many ways, like:</p>
                                <h3><strong>Helps Increase Presence and Intentionality</strong></h3>
                                <p>Has your partner ever told you that they feel like you're not there for them? Or, have you heard your loved ones complaining about how you never spend time with them, even though you're physically with them? CBT utilizes mindfulness to bring a person's awareness back to the present, allowing them to be more intentional with the time they can spend with their loved ones.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Build a Relationship That Feels More Like a Safe Haven</strong></h3>
                                <p>When pain and trauma from past relationships follow you to your next relationships, a toxic pattern of defensiveness and mistrust can develop, leaving you feeling alone and unsafe in your relationships. CBT offers effective tools for healing from wounds inflicted by past relationships, allowing you to build safer and more trusting relationships in the days to come.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3><strong>Boost Mood and Mental Health</strong></h3>
                                <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8489050/">CBT</a> is a scientifically backed way of boosting a person's mental health, which can boost their mood, as well. When your mental health and mood are struggling, so will your relationships. When you are in a good place mentally, you will have the capacity to care for your relationships properly.</p>
                                <h3><strong>Improves Communication Skills</strong></h3>
                                <p>CBT is a form of talk therapy, which means that you and your therapist will be tackling your mental health struggles by conversing about them. You will develop communication skills that show greater self-awareness, empathy, and self-regulation by talking out your feelings, thoughts, and emotions with a mental health professional.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Communication skills like these are essential to maintaining a healthy, thriving relationship. We will all experience disagreements and moments of tension from time to time. Having the skills to discuss them in a healthy, productive way with your partner can be crucial to solving them.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3><strong>Improves Your Self-Esteem</strong></h3>
                                <p>You might be wondering what self-esteem has to do with improving a relationship. It makes you feel like an equal partner in your relationship, as though you are a part of a team. When your self-esteem is struggling, so will your relationship. You may feel as though your partner does not truly wish to be around you. You may worry that they will find someone else. You may think your partner is out to get you, even when that is not the case. A healthy self-esteem will allow you to view your relationship from a healthy perspective.</p>
                                <h2><strong>Enhance the Best Parts of Your Relationship</strong></h2>
                                <p>When you are working on your mental health and overall well-being with cognitive behavioral therapy, you and your partner will be able to grow together and enhance the best parts of your relationship. The intimacy, teamwork, and support will be enriched, and the two of you will feel more healthy and secure in your relationship than ever before.</p>
