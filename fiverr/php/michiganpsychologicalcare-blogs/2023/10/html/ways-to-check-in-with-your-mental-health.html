<h1><strong>Ways to Check in with Your Mental Health</strong></h1>
<p>Your mental health plays a crucial role in your quality of life. Unfortunately, society has pressured many of us to push it off to the wayside for years.

<h2><strong>Ways to Check in With Your Mental Health</strong></h2>
<p>One of the best ways to care for your mental health involves knowing when your mental health is struggling. Checking in with yourself can be a great way of keeping tabs on your mental well-being. To check in with your mental health, consider these five questions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How Are You Feeling?</strong></h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the most obvious- how are you feeling? We ask each other this question so often that it often gets waved off with a simple, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; When you ask yourself this question, though, I want you to genuinely consider how you feel.</p>
<p>Have you noticed yourself feeling more stressed than usual? Has sadness become your new normal? Do your emotions feel out of control? Or are you feeling happy and healthy? Keep track of how you are really feeling. This can be one of the easiest ways to check in with your mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>What Struggles and Worries Are Weighing on You?</strong></h3>
<p>Consider what stressors are weighing on you. Is there something you can do about them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider what you can do to take these worries off your plate. Is there nothing you can do about them? Consider ways to let these go.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Are You Caring for Yourself?</strong></h3>
<p>Have you been feeling off but don&rsquo;t know why? Consider how you have been caring for yourself. Have you been setting and maintaining healthy boundaries? Have you been exercising and eating well? Have you been sleeping and giving yourself a chance to rest? Every single one of these self-care habits will impact your mental health.</p>
<h3><strong>Are You Making Time for the Things You Enjoy?</strong></h3>
<p>How often are you allowing yourself the time to have fun? It can be easy to push off fun and enjoyment without even realizing it, especially when life gets busy. Take the time to consider how often you are allowing yourself to do the things you enjoy.</p>
<h3><strong>How is My Support System?</strong></h3>
<p>Your support system plays a significant role in your well-being and resiliency. Take some time to consider who is in your corner. Who do you trust? Who would you turn to in your time of need? Who in your life is a great listener?&nbsp;</p>
