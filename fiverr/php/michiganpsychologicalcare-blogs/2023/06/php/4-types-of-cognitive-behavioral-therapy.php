                                <h1><strong>4 Types of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: What They&rsquo;re Used for and How They Work</strong></h1>

                                <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279297/">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&nbsp;</a>is one of the most common and research-supported forms of therapy in psychotherapy. It focuses on guiding a person to better understand their thought processes, feelings, attitude, and expectations.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy uses methods of discussion to dig deeper into a person's mind to find toxic thinking patterns and limiting beliefs. The therapist then provides the client with tips, coping mechanisms, or exercises to change them to more helpful and rational thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is not a one-size-fits-all form of psychotherapy. There are many types of cognitive behavioral therapy a therapist may pursue to get their patient feeling happier and healthier. In today's article, we are going to cover four major forms of CBT:</p>

                                    <li>Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)&nbsp;</li>
                                </ul>
