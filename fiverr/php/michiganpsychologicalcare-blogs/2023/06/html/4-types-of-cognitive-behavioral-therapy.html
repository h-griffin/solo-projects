<h1><strong>4 Types of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: What They&rsquo;re Used for and How They Work</strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279297/">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&nbsp;</a>is one of the most common and research-supported forms of therapy in psychotherapy. It focuses on guiding a person to better understand their thought processes, feelings, attitude, and expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy uses methods of discussion to dig deeper into a person's mind to find toxic thinking patterns and limiting beliefs. The therapist then provides the client with tips, coping mechanisms, or exercises to change them to more helpful and rational thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is not a one-size-fits-all form of psychotherapy. There are many types of cognitive behavioral therapy a therapist may pursue to get their patient feeling happier and healthier. In today's article, we are going to cover four major forms of CBT:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)</li>
    <li>Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)</li>
    <li>Multimodal therapy</li>
    <li>Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)</strong></h2>

<p>MBCT can be used for many different mental health struggles, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anxiety</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Multimodal Therapy</strong></h2>
<p>Multimodal therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on the client as a whole person rather than focusing on treating specific symptoms. Multimodal therapy utilizes a combination of different psychotherapy types and techniques to treat a person. In a multimodal therapy treatment program, the therapist may draw techniques from a wide range of different forms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-multimodal-therapy-5216156">psychotherapy</a>, including:</p>
