<h2><strong>Tips for Forgiving Someone Who Hurt You</strong></h2>
<p>Forgiveness does not always come easily. However, the benefits it has to offer can make the effort well worth it. If you are struggling to forgive someone who hurt you, a few tips include:</p>
<h3><strong>Acknowledge and Validate the Pain, Understand How It Impacts Your Feelings and Behaviors, and Work to Release Those Feelings</strong></h3>
<p>Your feelings about the situation are completely valid. Forgiving someone does not mean that you have to excuse or dismiss the way they hurt you. Allow yourself space and time to feel the emotions, and then actively choose to let them go- for your own peace and mental well-being.</p>
<h3><strong>Try to Put Yourself in Their Shoes</strong></h3>
<p>Empathy can allow you the chance to see the situation from the other person&rsquo;s perspective. None of us make the right decisions all the time, and you may be able to understand what led the person to hurt you if you try to see the situation from their shoes.</p>
<h3><strong>Use Mindfulness Techniques to Figure Out Your Thoughts and Feelings About the Situation</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes, putting in the effort to really understand your thoughts and feelings about the situation can allow you to release them more easily. A few mindfulness techniques you can use to do this include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Journaling</li>
    <li>Meditation</li>
    <li>Nature walks</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Know That Forgiveness Will Not Come Immediately</strong></h3>
<p>Forgiveness can take time and effort. It&rsquo;s okay if you still find yourself experiencing bits of resentment from time to time. Choosing to forgive someone does not make the feelings their behavior caused disappear overnight. Give yourself patience and compassion as you navigate this journey.</p>
<h3><strong>Seek the Help of a Counselor</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes, forgiveness can be hard to come by ourselves. In CBT therapy, a mental health professional can help you figure out your feelings and thoughts about the situation, understand the ways they are impacting your life, and figure out the best way to help you forgive.
