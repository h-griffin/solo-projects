<h1><strong>The Importance of National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/minority-mental-health/#:~:text=National%20Minority%20Mental%20Health%20Awareness%20Month%20is%20observed%20each%20July,illness%20in%20the%20United%20States."><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, July is National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. This means that the month of July is a month dedicated to bringing awareness to the unique mental health struggles faced by those who are considered ethnic or racial minorities in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health issues do not discriminate. However, a person&rsquo;s background, culture, and personal identity all impact how mental health conditions appear as well as the person&rsquo;s access to proper mental health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having access to proper mental health care should be a right awarded to each and every one of us. However,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nami.org/Get-Involved/Awareness-Events/Bebe-Moore-Campbell-National-Minority-Mental-Health-Awareness-Month"><span style="font-weight: 400;">due to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;cultural incompetence, lower access to care, and lower quality care faced by many minorities in America, this right is unjustly not granted to all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>About National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month saw its beginnings thanks to Bebe Moore Campbell, an African American author and journalist who worked every day to ensure her daughter had access to the mental health help she needed and deserved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her battle to help her daughter access high quality mental health care, Bebe learned just how inaccessible proper care could be to minorities in America. In July of 2008, Bebe Moore Campbell took the stand to address the U.S. Congress about the mental health care disparities faced by minorities in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her address to Congress, Bebe talked about her own experiences in trying to get her daughter the mental health care she needed. She talked about the challenges faced by too many citizens of ethnic or cultural minorities, especially in mental health care that goes beyond diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her address, Bebe also discussed the fears faced y minorities about admitting their mental health may be struggling. Already having to deal with racist or discriminatory stereotypes, many minorities fear that admitting to mental health struggles will only leave them further stigmatized by the people surrounding them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To attempt to further the awareness and changes Bebe was working so hard to bring, the U.S. House of Representatives made the decision to declare the month of July as National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bebe continues to further her mission to change the mental health care system by founding the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) chapter within her community, Inglewood, which is located in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<h2><strong>A Struggle to Access Quality Mental Health Care</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all deserve access to high quality mental health care. However, far too often, ethnic and culturally minority communities face struggles when it comes to accessing high quality mental health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health care can be expensive to some, especially those without health insurance that will cover their care.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;have found that when compared to White populations, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations seem to have lower levels of health care coverage- with Hispanic populations appearing to have the greatest barriers to health insurance than any other ethnic and cultural group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of these states, many minorities seek health care only when absolutely necessary, as preventative measures and regular checkups are just not affordable for them. Instead, members of these minority populations were found to be more likely to receive most of their health care through the emergency room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue with paying for mental health care is only the beginning of the plentiful disparities faced by minorities in our country. With so many stereotypes and stigmas faced by minorities, another disparity could be fear of furthering the discrimination and racism they deal with within their community. Different cultures have their own ideas and stigmas regarding mental health that mental health care providers must learn to be sensitive to. However, one of the most difficult obstacles a person within a minority community must face is overcoming the stigmas they have about mental health and seeking the care they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, the disparities don&rsquo;t end there. Language barriers can be yet another reason so many minorities struggle to access mental health care. Without access to mental health counseling therapists who can communicate with those that speak a different language, such as Spanish, many minorities will struggle to talk through the mental health issues they are facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are only a few of the many disparities in our mental health care system. We must continue to further our research, make changes, and create high quality mental health care for all. This is why the American Psychological Association has begun to place such an emphasis on the subject of cultural competence, a key competence needed by mental health care professionals to ensure their patients are receiving the health care they need and deserve.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Cultural Competence?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/03/cultural-competence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultural competence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;can be defined as having the ability to understand, welcome, and properly interact with individuals whose culture or systems of belief differ from one&rsquo;s own culture and beliefs. Having adequate cultural competence is so crucial to the practice of psychology. As one prepares to open and grow with the help of a mental health professional, they must first be able to trust them, which is why a psychologist with empathy and understanding of one&rsquo;s cultural and ethnic background can be so critical to quality patient care.</span></p>
