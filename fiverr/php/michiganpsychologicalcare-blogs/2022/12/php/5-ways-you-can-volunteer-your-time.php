                                <h2><strong>5 Ways to Volunteer Your Time for Mental Health Benefits</strong></h2>
                                <h3><strong>Consider Ways You Can Use Your Passion to Give Back to Your Community</strong></h3>
                                <p>You don&rsquo;t want to spend your free time doing something that leaves you feeling drained and miserable. This will do little more than leave you unmotivated and burnt out. When considering ways to volunteer your time, think about your passions and consider ways you can use them to help your community. There are plenty of ways you can use your talents and passions to give back to your community. You just have to get creative!</p>
                                <h3><strong>Offer Food Services for Programs That Deliver to Those Who Are Hungry</strong></h3>
                                <p>Meals on Wheels, soup kitchens, and food pantries in your area can offer great volunteer opportunities that allow you to help feed the hungry. These opportunities can be great if you love being around other people or if you love preparing and sharing food with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3><strong>Give Your Time and Social Skills to a Senior Center</strong></h3>
                                <p>Do you like hearing the stories other people have to share? Or perhaps you are great at keeping a conversation going. Senior centers and nursing homes can get lonely from time to time. Taking some time out of your day to play a board game with a senior citizen or just offer a listening ear for one of their thousands of awesome stories and memories can make more of a difference than you may know.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h3><strong>Volunteer Your Work Ethic Toward Building Houses for Those Who in Need of Shelter</strong></h3>
                                <p>Organizations like Habitat for Humanity offer those in need a place to call home. Not only will volunteering your time to building a home for someone else grant you a sense of accomplishment and importance, it will also teach you valuable life skills!</p>
                                <h3><strong>Take Some Time to Clean Up Your Favorite Beach, Park, or River</strong></h3>
                                <p>If you love the outdoors, volunteering to pick up trash in your favorite outdoor spot is a great way to enjoy nature. Putting in the effort to clean your community&rsquo;s best outdoor spaces will help you and those around you enjoy the outdoors so much more.</p>
