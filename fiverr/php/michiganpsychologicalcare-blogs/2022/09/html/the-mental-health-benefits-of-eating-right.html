<h1><strong>The Mental Health Benefits of Eating Right</strong></h1>
<p>We all know that if we eat healthy foods, our bodies will feel better. However, did you know that eating right can have a positive effect on your brain, as well? Yes, the foods you eat can impact your moods, stress levels, energy, and even cognitive functioning! In today&rsquo;s post, we will be discussing the benefits of eating a healthier diet and will provide some tips for potentially eating your way to a healthier brain.</p>
<h2><strong>The Mental Health Benefits of Eating a Healthy Diet</strong></h2>
<p>Eating a healthy diet has a multitude of benefits to offer those looking to reap mental health benefits. These benefits include:</p>
<h3><strong>Decreased Stress Levels</strong></h3>
<p>Stress can have a devastating and long-lasting impact on the health of your brain. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781050/#:~:text=Dietary%20fiber%20decreases%20inflammation%20throughout,depression%2C%20anxiety%2C%20and%20stress.">studies</a>&nbsp;have found that a healthy diet, particularly one with a healthy amount of dietary fiber, can lead to lower stress levels, benefiting your brain in the short-run and long-run.</p>
<h3><strong>Improved Cognitive Functioning</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6550267/">Studies</a>&nbsp;have found that caloric intake and the quality of one&rsquo;s diet can have significant impacts on their cognitive functioning and development. This relationship is believed to be due to the fact that a healthier diet can allow for healthier brain development, decreasing inflammation and allowing the brain to prosper.</p>
<h3><strong>Mood Boosting</strong></h3>
<p>I am sure that you have all heard of the term &ldquo;hangry&rdquo;. When we don&rsquo;t get enough nutritious foods in our day, we will normally find ourselves experiencing lower moods, a lack of energy, and irritability.</p>
<h3><strong>Decreased Risk of Certain Mental Health Conditions</strong></h3>
<p>There have been a number of studies that have found that individuals who eat healthier diets may find themselves at a lower risk of mental health conditions like depression. One&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23720230/">example</a>&nbsp;of these studies includes a review that found that those who followed a diet known as the Mediterranean diet appeared to be at a 32% lowered risk of depression when compared to those who did not eat a healthy diet.</p>
<h2><strong>Foods That May Encourage a Healthy Brain</strong></h2>
<p>So, what is considered a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; diet? &ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; can look different for different people, so developing the best diet for you may take the help of a health care professional. However, there are a few healthy food habits anyone can pick up to encourage a happier, healthier brain. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating enough food throughout the day</li>
<li>Eating more fruits- particularly berries</li>
<li>Eating more vegetables- particularly leafy greens</li>
