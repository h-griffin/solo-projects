<h1><strong>10 Ways You Can Support Your Mental Health (October 10 is World Mental Health Day)</strong></h1>
<p>October 10 is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day/2022">World Mental
        Health Day</a>, a day dedicated to raising awareness around the
    subject of mental health, supporting mental health movements around the world, and fighting the stigma that
    surrounds the subject of mental health.</p>
<p>This mental health day, we wanted to take a moment to discuss ten different ways you
    can support your mental health, allowing you to live a happier, healthier life.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting Enough Sleep</strong></h2>
<p>Your brain needs a break. As you sleep, your brain activity fluctuates, allowing you
    to move through the different stages of sleep throughout the night. Getting enough sleep has
    been&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mental-health"><span>better cognitive
            wellbeing</a>, including
    improved learning, thinking, concentration, and memory. It has also been associated with better mental and
    emotional wellbeing, allowing you to feel happier and better handle stress and difficulties.</p>
<h2><strong>Eating Enough Nutritious Foods</strong></h2>
<p>They don&rsquo;t call certain foods &ldquo;brain foods&rdquo; for nothing. Food plays
    a significant role in your cognitive, emotional, and mental wellbeing. Eating enough and eating nutritionally
    dense food will play an important role in taking care of your overall wellbeing.</p>
<h2><strong>Exercise</strong></h2>
<p>Exercise has been shown to improve one&rsquo;s mental health by reducing stress and
    anxiety, improving depression symptoms, decreasing low moods, increasing self-esteem, and improving cognitive
    functioning. So, get up and get your heart pumping. Your brain&mdash;and body&mdash;will thank you for
    it.</p>
<h2><strong>Practicing Gratitude</strong></h2>
<p>Gratitude is a great way to adjust negative thinking patterns and switch them to more
    positive ones. You can practice gratitude through mindful meditation, journaling, or simply taking a moment to
    think about a few things you are grateful for. You can even practice gratitude by thanking the people around you
    for the value they bring to your life.</p>
<h2><strong>Picking Up a Relaxing Hobby</strong></h2>
<p>Stress can have a significantly negative impact on one&rsquo;s mental health.
    Therefore, having a relaxing hobby to turn to during stressful moments in life can be crucial to maintaining
    your resilience against them. Some relaxing hobbies include yoga, breathwork, meditation, and art.</p>
<h2><strong>Practicing Mindfulness</strong></h2>
<p>There is a reason why so many therapists use mindfulness as a technique in their
    mental health toolbox. That reason is that mindfulness is incredibly beneficial to maintaining optimal mental
    health. Mindfulness is the act of focusing on the present moment. You can focus on your breath, your senses, or
    your feelings. The practice is intended to get you out of your head and into the present moment.</p>
<h2><strong>Being Social</strong></h2>
<p>Social connection is crucial to feeling your best mentally. So, don&rsquo;t forget to
    reach out to your loved ones, surround yourself with people who bring you joy, and be open to new, healthy
    relationships.</p>
<h2><strong>Reduce Stress Where You Can</strong></h2>
<p>Boundaries are your friend. Learning how to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to situations you
    know leave you feeling stressed and unhappy can be critical in caring for your mental health and overall
    wellbeing.</p>
<h2><strong>Set Realistic Goals</strong></h2>
<p>Goals can be beneficial for creating the life or mindset you dream of while
    increasing your motivation to pursue them. You can create goals to find inner peace, improve relationships, or
    become financially stable. Each step closer to your goal will allow you to feel a sense of accomplishment that
    keeps you going.</p>
<h2><strong>Getting a Mental Health Screening When You Need it</strong></h2>
<p>If your mental health is struggling, it may be beneficial to you to receive a mental
    health screening. Mental health screenings are used to determine if a person is experiencing mental illness. If
    you are ready to receive your own mental health screening, our professional and reliable therapists are here to
    help.&nbsp;<a href="https://michiganpsychologicalcare.com/contact.php"><span>Reach out</a>&nbsp;to us today, and we
