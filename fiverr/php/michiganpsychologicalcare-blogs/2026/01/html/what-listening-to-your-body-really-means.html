<h1><strong>What "Listening to Your Body" Really Means </strong></h1>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;Listening to Your Body&rdquo; is often used but rarely understood or explained fully. Listening to your body means being in tune with the emotional and physical sensations that our bodies produce. Oftentimes, these emotional and physical sensations carry messages and can indicate needs that the person might be neglecting. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9952303/">Self-awareness</a> is often required to be able to hear and notice the sensations that might arise. When people experience stress, anxiety, or trauma, they can find it difficult to listen to their bodies. Unresolved stress and trauma can lead to disconnection between people&rsquo;s hearts, bodies, and minds.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12154529/">nervous system</a> is powerful, and it does its best to protect us against threats. However, sometimes our nervous systems will identify situations as a threat when a threat isn&rsquo;t present. When our nervous systems are activated over and over, it can be difficult for people to differentiate between physical and emotional signals.</p>
<p>The first step in learning to listen to your body is becoming aware of it. This means being aware and open to the different signals our body might be sending. One way to work on awareness around sensations is to practice mindfulness. <a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/06/mindfulness-your-health">Mindfulness</a> is the practice of being aware of sensations and the present moment without judgment. Mindfulness can be a helpful tool in learning to listen to your body because it helps us to be aware without the need to respond or interpret the situation. Listening to our bodies doesn&rsquo;t always mean we have to interpret or respond to the situation. Instead, we should try our best to be still and mindful while allowing our bodies to signal what we need to hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to work on listening to your body is by practicing rounding techniques. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2319417022001585">Grounding techniques</a> are techniques that help people support nervous system regulation. Grounding techniques help to support awareness instead of avoidance. An example of a common grounding technique is deep breathing exercises. These techniques can be added to <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/caring-for-your-mental-health">self-care</a> routines and can help people focus on the present moment throughout their days.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the phrase &ldquo;listening to your body&rdquo; confuses people. However, listening to our bodies is actually a lot easier than we think when we are present. Listening involves noticing and naming the sensations we receive from our bodies and then responding to them. If someone struggles with anxiety or trauma, they might need to work with a therapist to work on body awareness. There is nothing wrong with needing extra help. Unfortunately, we live in a world that does not place importance on listening to our bodies. More often, we are taught to ignore our bodies. However, with thoughtful effort and patience, we can work on listening to our bodies and see the improvement in our mental health that comes along with it. We all deserve the effort to live a life more aligned with our nervous systems. Living a life where we can understand our body's signals helps promote peace and alignment within our entire life. </p>
