## Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
## Example
a = 3
b = 5

Print the following:
8
-2
15

## Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a .
The second line contains the second integer, b .

## Constraints
1 ≤ a ≤ 100
1 ≤ b ≤ 100

## Output Format

Print the three lines as explained above.

## Sample Input 0
3
2

## Sample Output 0
5
1
6

## Explanation 0
3 + 2 = 5
3 - 2 = 1
3 * 2 = 6


## Task
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a //b . The second line should contain the result of float division, a /b .

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

## Example
a = 3
b = 5

The result of the integer division 3//5 = 0 .
The result of the float division is 3/5 = 0.6.

## Print:
0
0.6

## Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a.
The second line contains the second integer, b.

## Output Format
Print the two lines as described above.

## Sample Input 0
4
3

## Sample Output 0
1
